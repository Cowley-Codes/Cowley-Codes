- Born & raised in __Manchester__ I love being a part of this city. 
- I am mad for guitar bands: Arctic Monkeys, Oasis, The Maccabees, Courteeners, Elbow, Nathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats, Caamp. I __strongly__ believe that Guy Garvey is a _genius_ & should be revered as one of the <ins>greatest songwriters of all time</ins>. 
- I ran my first (~~only?~~) marathon in 2024.
-  __Georg Cantor__ is my _dreamboat mathematician_, because I love all things $\infty\$ and his diagonal argument is deliciously elegant.
- I can recite $\pi$ to 115 decimal places but my true favourite number is __576__ because it doesn’t _feel_ like a square but it is.

<summary> The CAREER SWITCH Story </summary>

<br/>

As a maths teacher I have had tremendous fun trying to show teenagers the beauty and power of mathematics. 

Having climbed the education ladder as far as I’d like, I felt a window of opportunity to become a student again; to stretch myself, rather than my classes, to see what I can achieve.

On the recommendation of a Data Scientist friend, I tried the CFG kickstarter in SQL and I was hooked. 

Just over a year later, here I am on the path to becoming a Data Engineer at a company where I will have a truly positive impact on society - I couldn’t be more thrilled. __Thank you CFG!__

❓Answer for the square root of 576
 </summary>

<br/>

$576=24^2$, hence $\sqrt{576}=24$

A neat way to discover this is by prime factorising $576$ into $576=2^{6} \times 3^{2}$ and sharing into two matching groups of $2^{3} \times 3^{1}$

You can run my square and square root Python code to find more square numbers.
